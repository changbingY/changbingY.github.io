Hi, I’m Changbing Yang, a PhD candidate in Computational Linguistics at the University of British Columbia. My work sits at the intersection of low-resource languages and machine learning. The core aim of my research is to tackle low-resource challenges by creating new linguistic resources and designing models that learn effectively from limited data, ultimately advancing language technologies for under-represented communities. I build and evaluate NLP models ranging from lightweight, on-device models to LLMs (Large Language Models)—to advance automatic glossing, translation, speech processing, and linguistic documentation for under-represented languages. I’m passionate about creating practical tools that bridge theoretical insights and real-world applications, and I enjoy collaborating across disciplines to make language technologies more inclusive and accessible.
